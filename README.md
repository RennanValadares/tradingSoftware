Software Solution for a Brazilian Trading Company that im working in

I work for a group of company's and this project is a system for one of them. 
The company buy and sell grains and at the moment they dont have a system yet.

I have started this project programing in Python, but in the middle of it i have decided to change it to java. 
Now im working on it in java, but im doing it alone, and will take some time to finish it.
